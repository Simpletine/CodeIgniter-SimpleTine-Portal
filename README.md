### Introduction
SimpleTine Portal is a backend application built on [Ion Auth 4](https://github.com/benedmunds/CodeIgniter-Ion-Auth/tree/4) for authentication and user management, coupled with [AdminLTE](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE/tree/v3) for the entire UI. 

This initial architecture serves as a foundation for future system development, aiming to create a concept architecture capable of infinitely integrating modules.
